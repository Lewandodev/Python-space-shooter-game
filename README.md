# Python-space-shooter-game
Game project in python inspired by the "Space Invaders" game


This is my another game project. This one is inspired by the old aracade Shoot 'em up up games.
Almost all of the spaceships sprites have been done by me in GIMP. Backgorunds are a collage made of different free asset pxiel space backgrounds.
I used some of the free backgrounds that could be found on https://wallhere.com/ such as: https://wallhere.com/en/wallpaper/106712
The main player ship is a retexture (with few additions done by me) of the free 8bit spaceship sprite from: https://www.nicepng.com/
